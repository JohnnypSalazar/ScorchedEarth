SUMMARY OF COMPLAINT:  
I am filing a formal complaint of disability-based discrimination, retaliation, and civil rights interference by employees and representatives of the Orange County Public School (OCPS) system in Florida — specifically including individuals employed by or acting on behalf of OCPS Human Resources, Legal, and Administrative departments.

This complaint arises from a coordinated campaign of psychological coercion, character defamation, and unlawful misuse of mental health-related status, carried out under the color of authority. Several OCPS employees, including Danielle Granley (Special Education Teacher), Vanessa Zameza (School Psychologist), and Brian Raddick (School Principal), engaged in behavior that leveraged my psychiatric history to undermine my civil rights, discredit my personal character, and apply unlawful pressure through indirect channels — including eviction threats, character smears, and attempted custody interference.

These individuals, all acting in professional capacities under OCPS or in direct collusion with it, used mental health weaponization as a retaliatory measure in response to my protected activities. This included my advocacy efforts for ADA compliance, my refusal to accept coercive family-based settlement offers, and my exposure of unethical behavior within the school system.

Their actions fall squarely within the jurisdiction of the EEOC, as they involve:  
	•	Misuse of employment position to engage in retaliation.  
	•	Discrimination based on psychiatric history (a protected class).  
	•	Hostile behavior in collaboration with other public employees to deny equal protection under the law.  

⸻  

BEST FOR:  
✅ Government employees abusing their position to retaliate based on disability.  
✅ Coordinated attacks under the color of authority.  
✅ Non-employment victims harmed by employment-related abuse of power.
