## ‚ùóSummary of Complaint

This is a formal request for DOJ review and action regarding a disturbing and escalating pattern of ADA violations, retaliatory coercion, and deliberate denial of accommodations that constitute not only personal harm, but broader civil rights concerns under the ADA. The perpetrators are private individuals ‚Äî Danielle Granley and Vanessa [Last Name] ‚Äî who have orchestrated a campaign of harassment and deprivation specifically tailored to exploit and weaponize my diagnosed disabilities.

They have effectively denied me access to essential property, attempted to suppress or discredit my ADA protections, and used my disability status both as a tool of control and as justification for denying basic rights. This complaint also requests clarification on the DOJ‚Äôs jurisdiction regarding ADA-related abuses committed by private citizens using psychological coercion as part of denial-of-access patterns.

## üéØ ADA Violations ‚Äî Key Points

1. **Denial of Access to Essential Property as ADA Retaliation**  
I am the co-owner (or sole owner with active registration) of a vehicle which constitutes the only safe and reliable transportation available for fulfilling my ongoing medical, therapeutic, and psychiatric obligations tied directly to my disability plan. This vehicle has been withheld in retaliation after I asserted my rights.

2. **Exploitation of Psychiatric Diagnosis to Threaten Loss of Rights**  
My psychiatric diagnosis has been invoked as a threat to discredit me, implying that any legal defense or ADA complaint would be undermined by claims of ‚Äúmental instability,‚Äù including threats of involuntary commitment.

3. **Psychological Manipulation and Suppression of Accommodations**  
Instead of reasonable accommodation, these individuals have:  
- Mocked or gaslit me into believing my diagnosis invalidates my rights  
- Refused to return property or acknowledge financial obligations ‚Äúdue to your mental health issues‚Äù  
- Explicitly stated that pursuing ADA claims would lead to further retaliation or loss

4. **Deliberate Withholding of ADA-Protected Support Systems**  
I was denied access to medication, safe shelter, and communication devices. These were selectively withheld only after I began asserting ADA rights and seeking legal clarity.

5. **Coordinated Legal & Social Suppression**  
There is evidence that these individuals are being coached or assisted by legal professionals to craft filings that suggest my disability disqualifies me from making claims. This is a direct ADA violation and raises ethical concerns under bar guidelines.

## üìé Attached Evidence

- Screenshots of ADA accommodation requests being ignored or mocked  
- Text messages using my diagnosis as a threat  
- Photos of property I legally co-own being withheld  
- Statements referencing ‚Äúcalling cops‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting you committed‚Äù  
- A timeline showing ADA-related retaliation following protected activity

---

## üß† Additional Context

- I am a male domestic abuse survivor with disabilities, navigating post-relationship trauma while trying to uphold my ADA rights.  
- These are not isolated events ‚Äî they form a pattern of escalating retaliation, emotional manipulation, slander, and financial deprivation.  
- The intent behind this filing is not only to pursue personal justice, but to create visibility for other disabled individuals ‚Äî especially those overlooked due to gender, stigma, or lack of traditional support systems.

---

## üôè Requested Action

- DOJ review of whether this qualifies for Title II/III ADA intervention, or if federal statutes on coercion/retaliation/property deprivation apply  
- Clarification on whether coordinated misuse of legal threats or language constitutes an ADA violation when used to suppress accommodation  
- If jurisdiction allows, investigation into the role of Danielle Granley, Vanessa [Last Name], and any attorney involvement in the construction of these suppressive actions

Thank you for considering this complaint. I recognize that private-actor cases can be complex ‚Äî but if the ADA does not extend into interpersonal retaliation and psychological coercion, it risks being ineffective where it's most needed.

**Sincerely,**
