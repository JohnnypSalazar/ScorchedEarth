Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Complaint

To: U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division ‚Äì Disability Rights Section  
From: John Philip Salazar  
Subject: Retaliation & Harassment by Public Employees for Protected ADA Activity  
Date: [Today‚Äôs Date]

‚∏ª

üö® Executive Summary:

I am filing a formal complaint under the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II) against employees of Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) who retaliated against me for exercising federally protected disability rights. While I was in a medically recognized ADA crisis state, several OCPS employees‚Äîincluding Vanessa [Last Name]‚Äîengaged in targeted harassment, emotional manipulation, and orchestrated campaigns to further destabilize my condition.

They exploited my vulnerable state to drive an emotional wedge under false pretenses, misrepresented themselves as advocates while psychologically baiting me with provably false hope, and made efforts to shame me out of my ADA rights under the guise of ‚Äúhelp.‚Äù

‚∏ª

üß† The Disability & Its Recognition:
	‚Ä¢	I was actively undergoing treatment and evaluation for complex trauma and neurological effects connected to a long-standing mental health diagnosis.
	‚Ä¢	I had openly disclosed my disability status to relevant individuals in good faith, seeking clarity, resolution, and peace ‚Äî not retaliation.
	‚Ä¢	I made repeated efforts to explain boundaries, articulate symptoms, and ask for understanding.
	‚Ä¢	I was met instead with guilt, shame tactics, manipulative coercion, and bad-faith strategies designed to disarm me emotionally.

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è What They Did:
	‚Ä¢	Vanessa and others gaslit me during an ADA breakdown, telling me that the breakdown was my fault, and implying I deserved abandonment.
	‚Ä¢	While on a school-sanctioned trip across the state (while pretending to be at work), Vanessa used that time to manipulate me, urging me to ‚Äúwin back‚Äù a relationship she knew to be dead‚Äîan act that constitutes targeted emotional harm.
	‚Ä¢	She actively leveraged my ADA-recognized vulnerabilities, provoking emotional spirals to further a psychological power dynamic.
	‚Ä¢	At no point did anyone offer legitimate accommodation or support. In fact, they encouraged the opposite: retaliation, denial, and abandonment.

‚∏ª

üìú Legal Violations:
	‚Ä¢	Title II of the ADA prohibits public entities from retaliating or discriminating against individuals with disabilities who assert their rights.
	‚Ä¢	OCPS is a public entity.
	‚Ä¢	Emotional coercion and psychological sabotage constitute a hostile environment, especially when they are exploitative of a known disability.
	‚Ä¢	The staff‚Äôs actions meet the standard for ‚Äúdeliberate indifference‚Äù under ADA law.

‚∏ª

üß© Evidence Submitted:
	‚Ä¢	Screenshots of manipulation, coercion, guilt-tripping, and misrepresentation of intent
	‚Ä¢	Timeline proving Vanessa and other OCPS staff were off-campus without authorization
	‚Ä¢	My formal ADA-related disclosures and the lack of any formal response
	‚Ä¢	Evidence of gaslighting, dismissiveness, and retaliatory tone from OCPS employees

‚∏ª

üì£ Relief Sought:
	‚Ä¢	Launch of a DOJ investigation into OCPS disability response protocol
	‚Ä¢	Determination of ADA violation under Title II
	‚Ä¢	Public reprimand or civil penalties applied where appropriate
	‚Ä¢	Protective order blocking these individuals from further retaliatory contact
	‚Ä¢	Referral to relevant state and district-level ethics and HR boards
