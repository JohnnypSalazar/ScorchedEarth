### To the Internal Affairs Investigative Unit,

This letter constitutes a formal and urgent request for internal investigation into multiple incidents involving officers and affiliated personnel connected to [insert agency, e.g., Orange County Sheriff’s Office], who have used their status and access to retaliate, harass, and intimidate a civilian (myself) in what appears to be a coordinated attempt to suppress civil complaints, emotional safety, and ongoing legal claims.

---

### Nature of the Complaint

I believe the following criminal and administrative violations have occurred, either directly or by way of enabling others:

1. Retaliation against a person protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) after initiating a medical and housing-related complaint  
2. Harassment and intimidation through implied threats, text messages, and in-person visits  
3. Destruction and/or tampering with personal property in connection with this retaliation  
4. Unauthorized use or disclosure of police footage (e.g. bodycam, photos) to humiliate or discredit me privately and publicly  
5. Use of law enforcement status and personal connections to delay, misdirect, or dissuade civil filings against other parties involved  
6. Failure to provide equal protection under the law, as guaranteed by the Constitution, despite repeated complaints and documentation  

---

### Named Individuals & Known Affiliations

- Danielle Granley – Believed to be employed or closely affiliated with the Sheriff’s Office  
- Brian Raddick – Alleged co-conspirator with law enforcement ties; source of intimidation  
- Corey [Last Name] – Believed to be involved in transmission of false information to law enforcement  
- Vanessa and Pedro Zameza – Witnesses or participants in retaliatory behavior  

---

### Documented Incidents Include:

- Digital evidence of tampering with private AI research systems, potentially through law enforcement access or impersonation  
- Attempts to provoke psychological crisis or institutionalization to discredit the victim (me)  
- Threats of legal action paired with extortion-style payment demands in exchange for basic property or safety  
- Refusal to return property, followed by mockery using personalized meme content referencing known emotional triggers  
- Use of bodycam footage or law enforcement report data to fuel private threats or public embarrassment  
- Staged photographic evidence of discarded personal belongings to cause psychological distress  

---

### Immediate Requests

I hereby request:

1. A formal internal investigation into any known connections between these individuals and your agency  
2. A review of bodycam access logs to determine if any officer shared or weaponized footage or records  
3. Any employment record review regarding Danielle Granley and Brian Raddick, including known complaints  
4. Written confirmation that this complaint has been received, and the name of the investigating officer assigned  
5. All findings be documented and forwarded to appropriate oversight bodies, including the DOJ, ADA office, and Civil Rights Division  

---

### Final Statement

This is not merely about property or hurt feelings. It is about the abuse of public power to silence, retaliate, and humiliate a civilian who dared to file a complaint. I expect this to be handled with the seriousness required by law, and I am concurrently filing with the OCPS Human Resources Office, the Florida State Bar, the ADA Civil Rights Office, and multiple media watchdogs.

I am fully prepared to escalate this to the Office of Inspector General, and to seek federal relief under the Civil Rights Act and Whistleblower Protection Act, if necessary.

Please confirm receipt of this letter in writing within 7 business days.
