## Subject:  
**Formal Complaint Regarding Retaliation, Harassment, Misuse of OCPS Positions, and Interference with Disability Rights**  

---

### Dear Human Resources and Legal Department:

I am submitting this formal complaint to report retaliation, harassment, and misconduct by current or recent Orange County Public Schools employees and affiliates, including but not limited to Danielle Granley and Vanessa [Last Name], who have used their professional positions and access to OCPS resources to retaliate against me and intimidate me following my volunteer service with OCPS programs.

---

## Background  

- For several years, I volunteered at OCPS schools, particularly inner-city programs and at-risk youth classes.  
- My presentations focused on job readiness, professionalism, overcoming bias, and mental health resilience.  
- I received letters of recommendation from OCPS educators (Mrs. Genevieve Jackson, Mrs. Samantha [last name unknown]) documenting my positive contributions.

## Conduct at Issue  

Despite this service, I have experienced the following conduct from OCPS employees or affiliates:

1. **Retaliation and harassment**: Danielle Granley and Vanessa [Last Name] solicited my help with mental health guidance, disability navigation, and career mentoring, but then participated in or enabled extortion, property withholding, and harassment after I asserted my own ADA rights.  
2. **Use of OCPS positions to intimidate**: Respondents invoked their OCPS employment, union protections, and law‑enforcement contacts to warn me of “professional consequences” and instructed me not to contact OCPS work emails about my property or rights.  
3. **Possible misuse of internal information**: Respondents circulated or used law‑enforcement recordings (bodycam footage, reports) to intimidate me and my family, including sending recordings obtained without authorization.  
4. **Defamation of my mental health status**: Respondents publicly and privately disclosed my diagnoses and made false claims of criminal conduct, damaging my professional reputation and relationships.

## Requested Action by OCPS HR / Legal  

I respectfully request that OCPS:

- Open a formal HR investigation into the conduct of Danielle Granley and Vanessa [Last Name], including any misuse of OCPS resources, email accounts, or positions.  
- Preserve and produce all records of my volunteer service and communications between these individuals and myself, including emails, texts, and internal correspondence.  
- Issue a preservation hold to any OCPS custodians who may possess records or communications relating to me.  
- Advise me in writing of the outcome of this complaint, including any steps taken to prevent further retaliation or misuse of position.

## Additional Notes  

I am concurrently filing complaints with:

- Internal Affairs at the Orange County Sheriff’s Office (re: bodycam footage and intimidation),  
- Florida State Bar (re: potential attorney misconduct and legal intimidation),  
- Department of Justice ADA Division (re: retaliation and color‑of‑law misconduct).  

This complaint is intended to give OCPS an opportunity to address misconduct by its employees proactively and to protect the reputation of the district.

You may contact me at:
