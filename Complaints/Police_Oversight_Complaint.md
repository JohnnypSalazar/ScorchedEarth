üìå INCIDENT OVERVIEW:  

During the course of an ongoing psychological and civil rights campaign against me ‚Äî originating from school district employees connected to OCPS ‚Äî law enforcement personnel participated in off-record intimidation, informal threats, and failure to document or properly respond to complaints.  

Examples include:  
	‚Ä¢	Deputies arriving without initiating formal incident reports, instead giving ‚Äúpersonal advice‚Äù to abandon ADA filings or ‚Äújust let it go.‚Äù  
	‚Ä¢	Unmarked or minimally documented visits from officers acting on behalf of OCPS-connected parties, likely at the request of school staff or legal representatives.  
	‚Ä¢	Verbal warnings issued outside the bounds of due process, often designed to coerce compliance or silence from me while protecting institutional actors.  
	‚Ä¢	At least one officer refused to initiate a report about property interference and instead suggested I ‚Äútry mediation with her‚Äù (referring to the party actively threatening my housing and stability).  

These acts not only violate my civil rights but also jeopardize the integrity of your department by allowing individual officers to act as pawns in a civil harassment campaign.
