### To Whom It May Concern,

You are hereby formally notified to immediately CEASE & DESIST all forms of the following misconduct:
- Retaliatory actions arising from my invocation of ADA-protected rights
- Withholding, tampering with, or discarding my personal and professional property
- Defamation of character, slander, and dissemination of knowingly false claims
- Use of law enforcement connections, resources, or bodycam footage as intimidation tactics
- Digital intrusion into my private files and sabotage of AI development systems
- Demands for payment under threat of arrest or legal action
- Coordinated communication intended to mislead, gaslight, or destabilize my mental health

---

### Summary of Grievances

Since early 2023, I have been subjected to an escalating pattern of harassment, unlawful threats, and digital sabotage by individuals who have shown a flagrant disregard for my civil and disability rights.

I have documented:
- Ransom-style demands for money in exchange for my own belongings
- Threatening messages authored by third parties under your aliases
- Photos of sentimental property deliberately mocked, discarded, or posted for sale
- Staged evidence presented to family and law enforcement in a defamatory light
- Misuse of your public employment status and law enforcement associations
- Keylogging software targeting files named after you
- The intentional deletion and erasure of multiple AI projects, work backups, and encrypted containers

These acts are not only cruel â€” they are unlawful.

---

### Legal Standing

As a person with documented disabilities, I am entitled to full protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Civil Rights Act. Any retaliation for my attempt to access medication, support, or housing is a federal violation.

You are reminded that:
- Using public employment status to suppress complaints is unlawful  
- Disseminating altered, misleading, or private footage for intimidation is unlawful  
- Defamation, fraud, theft, and destruction of intellectual property are unlawful  
- Cyber intrusion and sabotage of personal digital infrastructure is very unlawful

---

### Demands

You are now formally ordered to:
1. Cease all direct or indirect contact with me unless mediated by legal counsel
2. Return all remaining property, or provide a notarized statement confirming its condition and location
3. Preserve all communications, devices, and records, including text messages, emails, device logs, and social media posts
4. Cease all defamatory or false representations, in any medium, about me or my work
5. Refrain from any further misuse of your employment status to delay, dismiss, or mock this process

**Failure to comply within 72 hours** will result in escalation to:
- Filing of civil and criminal complaints with the Department of Justice
- Involvement of federal cybercrime investigators
- Immediate delivery of all compiled evidence to attorneys, watchdog groups, press outlets, and applicable licensing boards
- Legal claims for damages, loss of business, emotional distress, defamation, and malicious interference

---

### Final Statement

I gave you every opportunity to resolve this amicably. I have waited over a year. This is your final chance. If you choose to ignore this letter, I will treat that choice as proof of intent to continue criminal behavior.

**Govern yourselves accordingly.**

**Sincerely,**  
John Philip Salazar
