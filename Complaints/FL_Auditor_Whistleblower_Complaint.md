Re: Whistleblower Report ‚Äî Misuse of Public Resources / False Attendance by OCPS Staff

‚∏ª

Dear Auditor General / Whistleblower Division:

I am submitting this complaint under Florida‚Äôs Whistle‚Äëblower Act regarding misconduct by employees of Orange County Public Schools (OCPS), specifically Vanessa [Last Name] (believed to be Vanessa Zameza) and potentially other OCPS staff.

On [insert approximate dates], these OCPS employees represented that they were engaged in official duties or at their assigned school sites, but instead traveled across the state to attend a private concert by [insert artist‚Äôs name] while on taxpayer time. During this same period, Vanessa engaged me in a coordinated campaign of manipulation regarding my private relationship with Danielle Granley ‚Äî conduct that appears to have occurred during taxpayer‚Äëpaid hours and using OCPS communication systems.

Key Allegations:
	1.	Misuse of Public Time and Resources.
Vanessa [Last Name] and potentially others left their official duty stations to attend a private concert. They presented themselves as working or at school while in fact traveling for personal entertainment.
	2.	Falsification / Deception.
If attendance logs or payroll records show these individuals were ‚Äúon duty‚Äù during the trip, this constitutes falsification of public records and misuse of state funds.
	3.	Inappropriate Use of Position.
While on taxpayer time, Vanessa used communications (text, email, or phone) to interfere with my private relationship, manipulate me, and potentially coordinate retaliation against me for asserting disability rights ‚Äî conduct unrelated to any OCPS function.
	4.	Pattern of Retaliation and Abuse of Position.
This misuse of public time is part of a larger pattern in which OCPS employees leveraged their positions and public contacts to intimidate, defame, and extort me, as detailed in my attached sworn affidavit.

Relief Requested:
	‚Ä¢	Conduct an audit / investigation into whether Vanessa [Last Name] and any OCPS colleagues falsified attendance, timesheets, or travel logs on [dates].
	‚Ä¢	Determine whether OCPS resources (emails, phones, vehicles) were used for private trips and harassment of private citizens.
	‚Ä¢	Preserve and obtain records of OCPS staff attendance, leave, travel reimbursements, and email logs on the relevant dates.
	‚Ä¢	Refer any criminal findings (fraud, falsification of records, misuse of public funds) to the appropriate law enforcement agency.

Attachments:
	1.	Sworn Affidavit of John Philip Salazar (PDF)
	2.	Exhibit A ‚Äî Screenshots of Vanessa‚Äôs texts during the concert trip
	3.	Exhibit B ‚Äî Any evidence of travel or attendance falsification (social media posts, photos, ticket stubs, etc.)
	4.	Exhibit C ‚Äî Timeline of harassment overlapping OCPS duty hours

I am willing to cooperate with investigators, provide witness names, and supply additional evidence under protective procedures. I request whistle‚Äëblower confidentiality and protection against retaliation to the extent allowed by law.

Sincerely,

/s/ John Philip Salazar
