Abuses included:

	•	Attempting forced eviction and economic coercion after complaints were filed  
	•	Using government positions to deny, delay, or undermine protections under the ADA

🎯 WHY THIS MATTERS:

The retaliation I’ve experienced was not just personal — it was institutional.  

Government actors deliberately:
	•	Denied my rights

	•	State and Federal Ethics Commissions  
	•	The Florida Auditor General  
	•	The Civilian Review Board  
	•	And now, Disability Rights Florida, as a direct invocation of federal P&A protection.
