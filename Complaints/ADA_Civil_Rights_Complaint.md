## Nature of Complaint

Pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act (Title II and applicable federal enforcement authority), and insofar as the conduct implicates federal civil-rights statutes and criminal laws, I hereby file this complaint of discrimination, retaliation, and interference based on disability.

I request that the Department of Justice investigate and, where appropriate, enforce the law or refer matters for criminal prosecution.

## Relief Sought
- Investigate whether respondents used public positions (OCPS, law enforcement) to retaliate against me for asserting ADA rights  
- Investigate misuse of law enforcement materials (bodycam, internal records) to intimidate  
- Investigate alleged digital intrusion and destruction of AI project data (potential cybercrime)  
- Enforce ADA protections and seek injunctive relief for property return  
- Refer criminal conduct to the appropriate federal authorities

## Jurisdiction

The DOJ has jurisdiction under Title II of the ADA and under civil rights law when state actors or public employees are involved. Multiple respondents are public employees, and the alleged violations involve misuse of public resources and retaliation.

## Background & Summary of Allegations
1. I am a person with documented disabilities (bipolar II disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia) who has served the public and private sectors as a mentor, volunteer, and AI developer. I have letters of recommendation and professional references (see Exhibit F).  
2. In early 2023, I was forced from the shared residence with Danielle Granley under threat of police interference and false allegations. I was not allowed to retrieve my medication, personal documents, or business hardware (Exhibit A).  
3. Since then, respondents have withheld, staged, or discarded my property — including sentimental items — and sent threatening, antagonizing photos of my belongings in garbage bags or posted online for sale (Exhibits B–C).  
4. I received conflicting monetary demands (\$6,600 → \$7,300 → \$3,000 → \$5,300), all framed as “ransom” for my belongings. Written threats exist stating I would be reported for theft, arrested, or sued unless I complied (Exhibit D).  
5. Respondents openly referenced their employment status (“protected by union,” “you don’t want problems with the school board”) and instructed me not to contact OCPS work addresses. This was retaliation designed to isolate and control (Exhibit D).  
6. They also used or shared internal sheriff’s department materials (bodycam video, reports, audio) in what appeared to be an intimidation tactic to undermine my credibility with family and colleagues (Exhibit E).  
7. There is strong evidence of digital sabotage:
   - Keylogger detected searching for “Pedro,” “Danielle,” “Vanessa”  
   - Deleted backups  
   - Disappearance of project folders  
   - AT&T breach notifications  
   - Loss of entire LLM development environment (Exhibits H–J)  
8. Communications from Danielle’s Gmail were shown to be authored by Brian Raddick, using mimicked style, structure, and linguistic quirks. This allowed him to communicate while masking authorship and increasing pressure (Exhibit K).  
9. Respondents repeatedly made defamatory claims — including bizarre, fabricated allegations (e.g., desecration of human remains, theft, mental instability) — all unsupported, with provable contradictions. These falsehoods impacted my business, reputation, and emotional safety (Exhibit L).

## Legal Theories for DOJ Review

**A. ADA Retaliation & Interference**  
Refusing to return medication, misusing law enforcement to silence me, and blocking communication channels as a means to punish disability-related disclosures are clear violations of ADA protections.

**B. Civil Rights Violations Under Color of Law (42 U.S.C. §1983)**  
If deputies assisted or enabled retaliation, or if public employment was used to suppress ADA complaints, this is a federal civil rights violation.

**C. CFAA / Federal Cybercrime Statutes**  
The digital intrusions, data loss, keylogger, and forensic evidence indicate a coordinated effort to destroy business data and AI development projects.

**D. Obstruction & Evidence Tampering**  
Photos staged to misrepresent the status of stolen property, active deletion of messages, and public sale of evidence all warrant criminal inquiry.

**E. Conspiracy / Enterprise Coordination (RICO Theory)**  
Should the DOJ find coordinated action between public and private actors, it may support a civil RICO claim for deprivation of rights and property.

## Remedies Requested
1. Immediate DOJ investigation and complaint docketing  
2. Issue evidence preservation notices to Danielle, Vanessa, Pedro, Corey, and relevant OCPS and law enforcement custodians  
3. Injunctions prohibiting further sale, destruction, or harassment  
4. Forensic imaging of devices suspected to hold tampered data  
5. Referral to FBI Cyber Division, Civil Rights Division, and any applicable local IA or prosecutor’s offices  
6. Public declaration of wrongdoing where appropriate  
7. Referral to victims’ assistance programs or ADA enforcement units
