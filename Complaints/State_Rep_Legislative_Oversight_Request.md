SUBJECT:

Request for Legislative Oversight ‚Äì Misuse of Public Office, ADA Retaliation, and Coordinated Harassment by Orange County Public Schools Employees and Associated Individuals

‚∏ª

INTRO: WHO I AM & WHY I‚ÄôM WRITING

Dear Representative [Name],

I am a lifelong Floridian, an ADA‚Äëprotected individual, and a volunteer who has given hundreds of hours mentoring at‚Äërisk students in Orange County Public Schools.  
I am writing because I have uncovered a pattern of behavior by public employees and their associates that crosses from ‚Äúunethical‚Äù into ‚Äúillegal‚Äù ‚Äî and I need your office to help me bring it into the light.

‚∏ª

BULLET SUMMARY ‚Äì THE BOMB ITSELF

‚Ä¢ Public employees and their associates (OCPS staff, their spouses, and local deputies) have:  
    ‚Ä¢ Withheld and sabotaged my property  
    ‚Ä¢ Extorted payments under threat of eviction/arrest  
    ‚Ä¢ Mocked my psychiatric disability in writing  
    ‚Ä¢ Misused bodycam and internal law‚Äëenforcement materials for intimidation  
    ‚Ä¢ Invoked their union positions and ‚Äúcontacts‚Äù in government to silence me  

‚Ä¢ I have preserved evidence:  
    ‚Ä¢ Screenshots of demands & threats  
    ‚Ä¢ Audio/video recordings of deputies contradicting their own threats  
    ‚Ä¢ Emails showing OCPS employees directing or condoning this behavior  
    ‚Ä¢ Photos of staged property and sentimental items dumped in trash bags  

‚Ä¢ This is ADA retaliation:  
    ‚Ä¢ I disclosed my psychiatric condition to these individuals and even helped them navigate their own.  
    ‚Ä¢ When I asserted my rights, they denied my disability, mocked me, and leveraged state authority to destroy my livelihood.

‚∏ª

WHY YOUR OFFICE NEEDS TO ACT

This isn‚Äôt just a private dispute.  
This is public employees weaponizing state power ‚Äî and mocking ADA rights ‚Äî against a constituent.

Your office has tools:  
    ‚Ä¢ Request briefings from OCPS and Orange County Sheriff‚Äôs Office  
    ‚Ä¢ Initiate legislative inquiries  
    ‚Ä¢ Refer to the appropriate committees (Education, Ethics & Elections, Public Integrity & Ethics)  
    ‚Ä¢ Issue public statements / constituent alerts

‚∏ª

WHAT I‚ÄôM ASKING

1. Take custody of my evidence package (affidavit, exhibits, DOJ complaints).  
2. Forward it to the Florida House Committee on Ethics, Public Integrity, and Elections.  
3. Request a public oversight hearing on misuse of state authority and ADA retaliation.  
4. Issue a formal preservation request to OCPS and OCSO to prevent destruction of records.

ENCLOSURES / LINKS

‚Ä¢ Final Sworn Affidavit of John Philip Salazar  
‚Ä¢ Cease & Desist Letter (sent)  
‚Ä¢ DOJ ADA Complaint (filed)  
‚Ä¢ Exhibits A‚ÄìM (photos, screenshots, audio logs)  
‚Ä¢ Sunshine Law / FOIA requests (pending)

‚∏ª

CLOSING / CALL TO ACTION

I am not seeking pity; I am seeking legislative accountability.  
If your office does nothing, this will become another headline about Florida‚Äôs failure to protect ADA‚Äëprotected individuals from retaliation by its own public employees.  

If your office acts, you have a chance to demonstrate that Florida stands for integrity, ADA rights, and protection of whistleblowers.

Please contact me at [phone] or [email] to coordinate receipt of the evidence package.

Sincerely,  
John Philip Salazar

üéØ Best Practice:  
Send the package certified mail to the rep‚Äôs district office and email it to their legislative aide.  
Attach the affidavit PDF, a one‚Äëpage exhibit index, and a link to a private online folder (Google Drive/Dropbox) with the evidence.

üí• Impact:  
If ignored, you have a public record that you warned them.  
If they act, you have a political champion. Either way, it‚Äôs on the record.
