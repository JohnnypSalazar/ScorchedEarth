## 1. Jurisdiction & Legal Basis
- The Florida Commission on Ethics reviews complaints alleging violations of the Sunshine Amendment (Art. II, Sec. 8, Florida Constitution) and the Code of Ethics for Public Officers and Employees, Chapter 112, Part III, Florida Statutes.  
- The Commission only acts if the complaint is sworn, made on its official form, and alleges conduct that a public officer or employee undertook that breaches public trust or conflicts of interest.  
- Complaints must be filed within five years of the alleged violation.

## 2. Statement of Facts (Concise, Legally Sufficient)

Below is a summary of the actions I believe violate the Code of Ethics. I have personal knowledge of these facts (or information not based on hearsay). I will provide supporting evidence upon request.

### (a) Abuse of Public Position / Use of Government Influence for Private Gain or Harassment
- The respondent(s), acting in their capacity as public employees (OCPS), have repeatedly used their official or semi-official status (school district authority, implied union protections, public employee identity) to intimidate, retaliate against, and harass me — a private citizen — in matters that are personal and private (property disputes, threats, mental health references).
- They have threatened “professional consequences,” invoked their status as OCPS employees to demand compliance, and explicitly referenced their public roles to exert pressure outside legitimate public duty.
- In communications, the respondent(s) have deliberately referenced my disability, mental health history, and psychiatric treatment as though those facts legitimize punitive treatment or remove me from legal protection.

### (b) Conflict of Interest / Improper Use of Information
- They have accessed or referenced internal documents, law‑enforcement reports, or bodycam footage (or intimated knowledge thereof) in private communications to threaten, discredit, or coerce me. This suggests misuse of privileged or governmental information for personal or retaliatory purposes.
- They have used ghost‑written legal language, template threats, or “legal-sounding” documents in texts or emails — beyond typical lay use — pointing to exploitation of internal legal or institutional knowledge.

### (c) Deception, Misrepresentation, or Concealment
- Respondent(s) have employed shared or forged Gmail accounts to send messages under aliases, conceal responsibility, and confuse authorship.
- They have staged photographic evidence (moved large furniture, placed sentimental items in trash bags, misrepresent inventory) to misrepresent the status of my property and create false narratives.

### (d) Retaliation and Breach of Ethical Duty
- After I began asserting my rights, sending formal notices, or preparing legal documents, the intensity and frequency of harassment, threats, and interference increased dramatically. This timing suggests retaliatory motive.
- Some of the respondent(s)’ conduct appears to be designed to dissuade me from pursuing legal or civil rights remedies — contrary to the public trust imposed on public employees.

## 3. Relief / Action Requested

I respectfully request that the Commission on Ethics:
1. Accept this complaint as legally sufficient and not dismiss it based on technicalities.
2. Open an investigation into the respondent(s)’ conduct under the Ethics Code.
3. Issue a preservation order requiring relevant public entities (OCPS, school board, law enforcement) to preserve all records, communications, and metadata associated with this matter.
4. Subpoena internal communications (emails, texts, personnel records) where the respondent(s) used public employee privileges or resources in these personal disputes.
5. Hold a public hearing if probable cause is found, and if violations are confirmed, recommend penalties (fines, public reprimand, disciplinary referral, removal from position) consistent with the Code of Ethics.
6. Report findings publicly, so that the misconduct is visible and deterrence is realized.
