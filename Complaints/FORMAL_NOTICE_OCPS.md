## üö® SUBJECT: FORMAL COMPLAINT & RECORD NOTICE ‚Äî OCPS EMPLOYEE MISCONDUCT AND RETALIATION

This letter serves as formal notification to Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) Legal Services and Human Resources that I am documenting and escalating misconduct, harassment, ADA retaliation, and potential FERPA and HIPAA-adjacent violations perpetrated by the following OCPS employees, operating both on-duty and off-clock:
- Danielle Granley (employee, teacher, OCPS affiliate)  
- Vanessa Zameza (employee and known OCPS collaborator)  
- Additional employees may be implicated as this expands.

---

## üî• Key Allegations

1. **Retaliation for Medical/ADA Accommodation**  
   - Ms. Granley repeatedly dismissed my disability as ‚Äúan excuse‚Äù and referenced her status as a teacher and union member as a form of immunity.  
   - I was denied reasonable accommodation for disability-related needs and was harassed for requesting access to medications, personal belongings, and therapeutic routines.

2. **Off-Duty Harassment While Citing OCPS Authority**  
   - Multiple communications involved threats of ‚Äúemployment consequences,‚Äù invoking OCPS power during personal matters to intimidate and manipulate.  
   - This creates vicarious liability for OCPS, as their positions were used to control, coerce, and extort ‚Äî sometimes in conjunction with property disputes.

3. **Abuse of Internal Systems and Records**  
   - Bodycam footage and law enforcement reports appear to have been requested, distributed, or referenced by individuals with OCPS connections.  
   - Internal emails and texts suggest someone ‚Äúused the system‚Äù to obtain reports for private leverage.

4. **Harassment and Psychological Abuse**  
   - I received messages explicitly referencing my mental health history, suicide ideation, medication, and past trauma in ways that appear intended to destabilize me.  
   - When I expressed distress, I was told I was ‚Äúoverreacting‚Äù or ‚Äúimagining it,‚Äù in clear textbook gaslighting ‚Äî something particularly egregious given OCPS‚Äôs obligation to safeguard mental wellness.

5. **Digital Evidence Destruction and Sabotage**  
   - Files related to my AI research, which documented my condition and daily function, were corrupted, with backups deleted or sabotaged shortly after confrontations with the individuals above.  
   - AT&T logs suggest my devices were accessed remotely and specifically searched for folders containing their names or identifying keywords.

## üìö Legal Exposure and Employer Liability

- **ADA Title II / III** ‚Äî Protects individuals from retaliation when seeking disability accommodation, including from public-sector employees invoking their authority.  
- **FERPA / HIPAA-Adjacent Harm** ‚Äî Mentioning internal knowledge of my medical history or behavioral evaluations may implicate confidential student/family records and violates ethical policy.  
- **Vicarious Liability** ‚Äî OCPS employees using their positions to intimidate, harass, or defame me during personal disputes opens the district to legal and reputational exposure.  
- **Failure to Supervise / Correct** ‚Äî If OCPS Legal/HR was aware of this misconduct (or should have been) and took no action, they are complicit in the escalation of harm.

---

## üì£ Actions Requested

- Immediate preservation of all OCPS records referencing me, including emails, Teams messages, personnel memos, and student/employee reports.  
- A formal HR investigation into Ms. Granley, Ms. Zameza, and any associated actors involved in using OCPS credentials or channels to intimidate, retaliate, or harass.  
- Confirmation from your office whether OCPS policy allows employees to weaponize their positions off-duty in property or personal disputes ‚Äî especially where the ADA or suicide risk is involved.

## üß® Public Impact Warning

Please be advised that if this matter is not addressed internally and professionally, it will proceed to:

- The Office of the Inspector General (complaint already filed)  
- The U.S. Department of Education ‚Äì Office for Civil Rights  
- The Florida Department of Education ‚Äì Professional Practices Services  
- The Florida Bar (if additional parties are attorneys or public officers)

Additionally, I have begun logging these events for inclusion in a public-facing documentary and open-source evidence repository addressing public-employee abuse of power and systemic retaliation.

## üìé Supporting Evidence (Available on Request)

- Screenshots of threats and off-duty OCPS invocations  
- Metadata and filenames associated with digital sabotage  
- AT&T intrusion alerts and file corruption logs  
- Cease & desist letters with certified mail receipts
