🧨 SUMMARY OF MISCONDUCT

This complaint outlines a coordinated series of abuses by school district officials, public attorneys, and affiliated intermediaries, who weaponized government positions to:
	•	Retaliate against my disability accommodations under the ADA and FCRA.
	•	Harass me through off-record legal threats, including eviction intimidation and coercion to withdraw civil rights complaints.
	•	Manipulate law enforcement to act informally on behalf of district actors.
	•	Suppress documentation by using social engineering, mock diagnoses, and off-the-record lawyering.

Despite clear evidence and repeated attempts to report, no meaningful action was taken by local prosecutors or district attorneys, suggesting:
	•	A conflict of interest
	•	Willful blindness
	•	Misuse of prosecutorial discretion

Several attorneys involved in this matter — including individuals at the school board level — may have ghostwritten legal threats, impersonated law enforcement strategy, or knowingly participated in retaliatory schemes against a disabled civilian complainant.
