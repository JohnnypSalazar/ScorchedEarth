## Subject:  
**Complaint of Legal Misconduct, Abuse of Authority, and Retaliatory Use of Legal Processes by Private Individuals with Access to Legal Privilege**  

---

### Dear ACAP / Florida Bar Investigations Unit,

I am submitting this formal complaint to report potential misconduct involving the unauthorized or unethical use of legal processes by private individuals who either possess legal training, are closely affiliated with legal professionals, or are receiving support from attorneys in a manner that constitutes abuse of legal process and retaliatory coercion.

---

## Parties Involved  

- Danielle Granley – former romantic partner and active agent in threatening legal action without basis  
- Vanessa [Last Name] – accomplice and advocate, allegedly coordinating legal strategies and participating in reputation damage  
- Unidentified legal enablers – including references to unnamed lawyers providing templates, instructions, or ghostwriting filings, which have been used for personal vendetta  

---

## Background and Context  

I am currently involved in an ongoing dispute involving stolen property, harassment, and retaliation linked to a romantic and business partnership. What began as a personal dispute has escalated into a pattern of lawfare — that is, the use of legal threats, filings, and accusations designed to intimidate me, derail my disability claims, and suppress documentation of abuse.

Examples of misconduct include:

- Threats of police involvement for fabricated or trivial claims (e.g., a “missing necklace” trap used to bait me into confrontation)  
- Misuse of legal-sounding letters intended to misrepresent civil matters as criminal (i.e., “you committed theft for refusing to hand over a vehicle you’re legally co‑signed on”)  
- Threats of psychiatric evaluation weaponized in tandem with legal filings (“We’ll say you’re unstable, bipolar, and get you committed”)  
- Statements that appear to come from or be crafted by legal professionals, including phrases like “you are violating this statute” or “you are at risk of civil litigation under…”

## Concerns and Basis for Bar Investigation  

Though the individuals above may not be licensed attorneys, their use of legal process and language bears the unmistakable signature of someone with bar knowledge, suggesting ghostwritten filings, behind‑the‑scenes coaching, or unethical legal support designed for personal retaliation.

This weaponization of legal process:

- Violates the spirit and often the letter of Florida Bar ethics codes  
- May constitute unauthorized practice of law if the legal strategies were drafted or filed by someone acting outside their scope  
- Harms public trust in legal integrity and sets a dangerous precedent for law being used as a tool of coercion rather than justice  

---

## Requested Action  

I ask the Florida Bar to investigate whether:

- Any Florida-licensed attorneys are assisting in these campaigns  
- Legal templates, court filings, or legal threats being issued under false pretenses were drafted or coached by a bar member  
- Any attorney involved has failed to perform due diligence, or is participating in ethical violations under Rule 4-8.4 (Misconduct) and 10-2.2 (UPL)  

---

## Attachments and Evidence  

- Screenshots of text messages containing legal threats and coercive language  
- Audio recordings referencing “my lawyer said” or “my attorney’s drafting this”  
- Timeline of filings and threats that mirror civil process filings  
- Evidence of abuse of process and misuse of law enforcement as legal intimidation  

---

Please confirm receipt of this complaint and advise me of any further steps I must take to provide supporting documentation. I’m happy to appear or testify should further clarification be needed.

**Sincerely,**  
John Philip Salazar
