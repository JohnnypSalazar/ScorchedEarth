### 2️⃣ What Happened

I am a person with documented disabilities (bipolar II disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia). I have volunteered extensively for OCPS programs and chaired the Florida NAR Young Professionals Committee. Respondents used my disability status to manipulate, harass, and intimidate me.

**Key acts include:**
- Being forced from a shared residence under false arrest threats by an OCPS employee (Danielle Granley), with critical medications, identification, and work devices withheld.  
- OCPS staff (Vanessa) using work time and travel time to gaslight me into “saving” a relationship she knew was over, aggravating my condition.  
- Repeated demands for inconsistent sums of money ($3,000–$7,300) in exchange for access to my own property.  
- Circulating law‑enforcement materials (body‑cam footage, internal reports) to intimidate me and my family.  
- Defaming me publicly and privately as unstable and criminal (“desecration of human remains”), destroying my reputation and business opportunities.  
- Digital sabotage of my research environments (AI/continuity logs) traced to respondents (AT&T alerts, device logs preserved).

I have attached an affidavit and exhibits with screenshots, audio logs, photographs, and metadata proving these acts.

### 3️⃣ ADA Rights Violated

- Title II: Retaliation and discrimination by a public entity (OCPS) and its employees.  
- Interference with my ability to access medication, property, and public services.  
- Misuse of public office to intimidate and coerce a person asserting disability rights.  
- Creating a hostile environment designed to provoke a psychiatric crisis.
