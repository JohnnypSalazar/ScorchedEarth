1. Summary of Complaint  
I am submitting this complaint to report a pattern of systemic misconduct, civil rights violations, and abuse of government authority involving local law enforcement and public employees, which may fall under DOJ oversight due to federal partnerships (e.g., federally funded programs, federal seizure laws, DOJ task force cross-designation, or ADA compliance mechanisms).

While these individuals are not all federal employees, their actions appear to violate federal statutes and implicate agencies receiving federal funding or operating under federal oversight. I am requesting a federal review and referral to appropriate sub-agencies or civil rights divisions.

2. Basis for Federal Jurisdiction  
The following federal statutes, rights, and jurisdictions appear to be implicated:  
• Color of Law Violations (18 U.S.C. § 242): Local officers abusing authority under the “color of law” to violate civil rights.  
• Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. § 1985(3)): Coordinated intimidation, threats, or denial of legal protections.  
• ADA Violations: Targeting an individual with known psychiatric disability in discriminatory, harassing, or exclusionary ways.  
• Abuse of Access / Misuse of Federal Databases: Potential misuse of NCIC, DOJ-aligned systems, or records protected under HIPAA/FERPA.  
• Misuse of Federal Law Enforcement Partnerships: False claims of legal authority, threats involving federal agencies (FBI, ATF, etc.) used to intimidate or mislead.  
• Fraud in Federally Funded Programs (e.g., public school districts receiving DOE/DOJ funds used to retaliate against whistleblowers or civilians).

3. Description of Events  
I have documented a multi-month campaign of retaliation and misconduct by individuals tied to the Orange County Public School System, local law enforcement, and associated private collaborators — some of whom are employees of public entities receiving federal funding. These individuals have engaged in:  
• Direct threats to my safety and liberty using legal-sounding but unofficial language (e.g., threatening me with “mental health holds,” fraudulent accusations, seizure of property).  
• Coercion and extortion involving sentimental and valuable property being held for “ransom” under threat of destruction.  
• Weaponization of disability: My psychiatric diagnosis has been used to delegitimize my legal rights and threaten court action, contrary to ADA protections.  
• Potential misuse of law enforcement bodycams, reports, or backchannel access to private legal data — used to justify personal vendettas.  
• Coordinated psychological warfare through harassment, false accusations, and ghostwritten statements distributed across official platforms.  
• Public officials mocking or memeing mental health struggles, invoking protected characteristics as justification for social punishment or eviction from public trust.  

These actions have escalated to include threats of falsified legal filings, defamation to third parties (including my family), and intimidation using misleading language meant to simulate official orders.

4. Why This Warrants Federal Review  
This is not simply a local personnel dispute. This is a civil rights case in slow motion — one that has not been taken seriously by local oversight, and where every remedy is being delayed, mocked, or derailed by insiders who are “in the club.”  

When a school district employee, backed by her friends in local government, believes she can openly:  
• Use her OCPS badge to intimidate citizens  
• Weaponize mental illness to destroy someone’s reputation  
• Use “official-sounding” fake legal documents to coerce someone into surrender  
• Destroy or threaten seizure of property without a court order  
• And then mock that person’s trauma in memes and texts…  

…then we are beyond civil court filings. This is not small-town cruelty. This is a failure of federal civil rights protections to reach the people they were designed to shield.

5. Relief / Request for Action  
I respectfully request the following from the Office of Inspector General:  
1. Open an investigation or refer this matter to the appropriate internal division (e.g., DOJ Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section, Disability Rights Section).  
2. Issue preservation notices to local entities (school board, law enforcement) to retain any bodycam footage, emails, or texts relevant to the intimidation campaign.  
3. Review any DOJ-funded programs, grants, or partnerships tied to these employees or institutions, to determine if federal resources are being misused.  
4. Investigate cross-designated officers or DOJ task force involvement, if any, in enabling the retaliation or false arrests.  
5. Contact the U.S. Attorney’s Office to request an evaluation for civil or criminal charges under § 242 or § 1985, if merited.

⸻

6. Supporting Evidence  
I am prepared to provide a comprehensive dossier of:  
• Screenshots of threats, memes, and intimidation  
• Voicemails and messages referencing unlawful holds or seizures  
• Timeline of events showing escalation after legal assertion of rights  
• Documentation of psychiatric disability and relevant ADA protections  
• Names and affiliations of all involved public employees  

I am also building a full legal archive and video documentary, and I am willing to testify under oath.
