Multiple respondents are public employees, and the alleged violations involve misuse of public resources and retaliation. Background & Summary of Allegations I am a person with documented disabilities (bipolar II disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia) who has served the public and private sectors as a mentor, volunteer, and AI developer. I have letters of recommendation and professional references (see Exhibit F). In early 2023, I was forced from the shared residence with Danielle Granley under threat of police interference and false allegations. I was not allowed to retrieve my medication, personal documents, or business hardware (Exhibit A). Since then, respondents have withheld, staged, or discarded my property \u2014 including sentimental items \u2014 and sent threatening, antagonizing photos of my belongings in garbage bags or posted online for sale (Exhibits B\u2013C). I received conflicting monetary demands (\\$6,600 \u2192 \\$7,300 \u2192 \\$3,000 \u2192 \\$5,300), all framed as \u201cransom\u201d for my belongings. Written threats exist stating I would be reported for theft, arrested, or sued unless I complied (Exhibit D). Respondents openly referenced their employment status (\u201cprotected by union,\u201d \u201cyou don\u2019t want problems with the school board\u201d) and instructed me not to contact OCPS work addresses. This was retaliation designed to isolate and control (Exhibit D). They also used or shared internal sheriff\u2019s department materials (bodycam video, reports, audio) in what appeared to be an intimidation tactic to undermine my credibility with family and colleagues (Exhibit E). There is strong evidence of digital sabotage: Keylogger detected searching for \u201cPedro,\u201d \u201cDanielle,\u201d \u201cVanessa\u201d Deleted backups Disappearance of project folders AT&T breach notifications Loss of entire LLM development environment (Exhibits H\u2013J) Communications from Danielle\u2019s Gmail were shown to be authored by Brian Raddick, using mimicked style, structure, and linguistic quirks. This allowed him to communicate while masking authorship and increasing pressure (Exhibit K). Respondents repeatedly made defamatory claims \u2014 including bizarre, fabricated allegations (e.g., desecration of human remains, theft, mental instability) \u2014 all unsupported, with provable contradictions. These falsehoods impacted my business, reputation, and emotional safety (Exhibit L). Legal Theories for DOJ Review A.

B. Civil Rights Violations Under Color of Law (42 U.S.C. \u00a71983) If deputies assisted or enabled retaliation, or if public employment was used to suppress ADA complaints, this is a federal civil rights violation.

While I was in a medically recognized ADA crisis state, several OCPS employees\u2014including Vanessa [Last Name]\u2014engaged in targeted harassment, emotional manipulation, and orchestrated campaigns to further destabilize my condition. They exploited my vulnerable state to drive an emotional wedge under false pretenses, misrepresented themselves as advocates while psychologically baiting me with provably false hope, and made efforts to shame me out of my ADA rights under the guise of \u201chelp.\u201d \u2e3b \ud83e\udde0 The Disability & Its Recognition: \u2022 I was actively undergoing treatment and evaluation for complex trauma and neurological effects connected to a long-standing mental health diagnosis. \u2022 I had openly disclosed my disability status to relevant individuals in good faith, seeking clarity, resolution, and peace \u2014 not retaliation. \u2022 I made repeated efforts to explain boundaries, articulate symptoms, and ask for understanding. \u2022 I was met instead with guilt, shame tactics, manipulative coercion, and bad-faith strategies designed to disarm me emotionally. \u2e3b \u26a0\ufe0f What They Did: \u2022 Vanessa and others gaslit me during an ADA breakdown, telling me that the breakdown was my fault, and implying I deserved abandonment. \u2022 While on a school-sanctioned trip across the state (while pretending to be at work), Vanessa used that time to manipulate me, urging me to \u201cwin back\u201d a relationship she knew to be dead\u2014an act that constitutes targeted emotional harm. \u2022 She actively leveraged my ADA-recognized vulnerabilities, provoking emotional spirals to further a psychological power dynamic. \u2022 At no point did anyone offer legitimate accommodation or support. In fact, they encouraged the opposite: retaliation, denial, and abandonment. \u2e3b \ud83d\udcdc Legal Violations: \u2022 Title II of the ADA prohibits public entities from retaliating or discriminating against individuals with disabilities who assert their rights. \u2022 OCPS is a public entity. \u2022 Emotional coercion and psychological sabotage constitute a hostile environment, especially when they are exploitative of a known disability. \u2022 The staff\u2019s actions meet the standard for \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d under ADA law. \u2e3b \ud83e\udde9 Evidence Submitted: \u2022 Screenshots of manipulation, coercion, guilt-tripping, and misrepresentation of intent \u2022 Timeline proving Vanessa and other OCPS staff were off-campus without authorization \u2022 My formal ADA-related disclosures and the lack of any formal response \u2022 Evidence of gaslighting, dismissiveness, and retaliatory tone from OCPS employees \u2e3b \ud83d\udce3 Relief Sought: \u2022 Launch of a DOJ investigation into OCPS disability response protocol \u2022 Determination of ADA violation under Title II \u2022 Public reprimand or civil penalties applied where appropriate \u2022 Protective order blocking these individuals from further retaliatory contact \u2022 Referral to relevant state and district-level ethics and HR boards","title":"DOJ ADA Complaint"},{"location":"Complaints/ADA_Complaint_DOJ_Portal_Ready/","text":"Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Complaint \u2013 Portal-Ready Version Complainant: John Philip Salazar [Mailing address] [Email address] [Phone number] Respondents: \u2022 Danielle Granley (Orange County Public Schools employee) \u2022 Vanessa [Last Name] (OCPS employee) \u2022 Brian Raddick (private individual, co\u2011coordinator of coercive communications) \u2022 Pedro [Last Name] (private individual, alleged digital sabotage) \u2022 Corey [Last Name] (landlord/property custodian) \u2022 Three unnamed deputies, one judge, one detective (Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office / county personnel) Public Entities Involved: \u2022 Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) \u2022 Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Office 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Title of Complaint Retaliation & Harassment by Public Employees for Protected ADA Activity 2\ufe0f\u20e3 What Happened I am a person with documented disabilities (bipolar II disorder, anxiety, agoraphobia).

While these individuals are not all federal employees, their actions appear to violate federal statutes and implicate agencies receiving federal funding or operating under federal oversight. I am requesting a federal review and referral to appropriate sub-agencies or civil rights divisions. \u2e3b Basis for Federal Jurisdiction The following federal statutes, rights, and jurisdictions appear to be implicated: \u2022 Color of Law Violations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242): Local officers abusing authority under the \u201ccolor of law\u201d to violate civil rights. \u2022 Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3)): Coordinated intimidation, threats, or denial of legal protections. \u2022 ADA Violations: Targeting an individual with known psychiatric disability in discriminatory, harassing, or exclusionary ways. \u2022 Abuse of Access / Misuse of Federal Databases: Potential misuse of NCIC, DOJ-aligned systems, or records protected under HIPAA/FERPA. \u2022 Misuse of Federal Law Enforcement Partnerships: False claims of legal authority, threats involving federal agencies (FBI, ATF, etc.) used to intimidate or mislead. \u2022 Fraud in Federally Funded Programs (e.g., public school districts receiving DOE/DOJ funds used to retaliate against whistleblowers or civilians). \u2e3b Description of Events I have documented a multi-month campaign of retaliation and misconduct by individuals tied to the Orange County Public School System, local law enforcement, and associated private collaborators \u2014 some of whom are employees of public entities receiving federal funding. These individuals have engaged in: \u2022 Direct threats to my safety and liberty using legal-sounding but unofficial language (e.g., threatening me with \u201cmental health holds,\u201d fraudulent accusations, seizure of property). \u2022 Coercion and extortion involving sentimental and valuable property being held for \u201cransom\u201d under threat of destruction. \u2022 Weaponization of disability: My psychiatric diagnosis has been used to delegitimize my legal rights and threaten court action, contrary to ADA protections. \u2022 Potential misuse of law enforcement bodycams, reports, or backchannel access to private legal data \u2014 used to justify personal vendettas. \u2022 Coordinated psychological warfare through harassment, false accusations, and ghostwritten statements distributed across official platforms. \u2022 Public officials mocking or memeing mental health struggles, invoking protected characteristics as justification for social punishment or eviction from public trust. These actions have escalated to include threats of falsified legal filings, defamation to third parties (including my family), and intimidation using misleading language meant to simulate official orders. \u2e3b Why This Warrants Federal Review This is not simply a local personnel dispute. This is a civil rights case in slow motion \u2014 one that has not been taken seriously by local oversight, and where every remedy is being delayed, mocked, or derailed by insiders who are \u201cin the club.\u201d When a school district employee, backed by her friends in local government, believes she can openly: \u2022 Use her OCPS badge to intimidate citizens \u2022 Weaponize mental illness to destroy someone\u2019s reputation \u2022 Use \u201cofficial-sounding\u201d fake legal documents to coerce someone into surrender \u2022 Destroy or threaten seizure of property without a court order \u2022 And then mock that person\u2019s trauma in memes and texts\u2026 \u2026then we are beyond civil court filings. This is not small-town cruelty. This is a failure of federal civil rights protections to reach the people they were designed to shield. \u2e3b Relief / Request for Action I respectfully request the following from the Office of Inspector General: Open an investigation or refer this matter to the appropriate internal division (e.g., DOJ Civil Rights Division, Special Litigation Section, Disability Rights Section). Issue preservation notices to local entities (school board, law enforcement) to retain any bodycam footage, emails, or texts relevant to the intimidation campaign. Review any DOJ-funded programs, grants, or partnerships tied to these employees or institutions, to determine if federal resources are being misused. Investigate cross-designated officers or DOJ task force involvement, if any, in enabling the retaliation or false arrests. Contact the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office to request an evaluation for civil or criminal charges under \u00a7 242 or \u00a7 1985, if merited. \u2e3b Supporting Evidence I am prepared to provide a comprehensive dossier of: \u2022 Screenshots of threats, memes, and intimidation \u2022 Voicemails and messages referencing unlawful holds or seizures \u2022 Timeline of events showing escalation after legal assertion of rights \u2022 Documentation of psychiatric disability and relevant ADA protections \u2022 Names and affiliations of all involved public employees I am also building a full legal archive and video documentary, and I am willing to testify under oath. \u2e3b Signature Respectfully, John Philip Salazar [Phone] | [Email] | [City/State]","title":"Inspector General Complaint"},{"location":"Complaints/Disability_Rights_Florida_Complaint/","text":"FORMAL COMPLAINT \u2013 DISABILITY RIGHTS FLORIDA Subject: Retaliatory Abuse, ADA Violations, Psychiatric Weaponization, and Rights Interference by Public Entities To: Disability Rights Florida 2473 Care Drive, Suite 200 Tallahassee, FL 32308 \ud83d\udce8 Online Intake: https://disabilityrightsflorida.org From: [Your Full Name] [Contact Info] [Location] \u2e3b \ud83e\udde0 SUMMARY OF VIOLATIONS This complaint describes a systematic campaign of abuse and retaliation stemming from a psychiatric disability disclosure and request for accommodations.

On [insert approximate dates], these OCPS employees represented that they were engaged in official duties or at their assigned school sites, but instead traveled across the state to attend a private concert by [insert artist\u2019s name] while on taxpayer time. During this same period, Vanessa engaged me in a coordinated campaign of manipulation regarding my private relationship with Danielle Granley \u2014 conduct that appears to have occurred during taxpayer\u2011paid hours and using OCPS communication systems. Key Allegations: 1. Misuse of Public Time and Resources. Vanessa [Last Name] and potentially others left their official duty stations to attend a private concert. They presented themselves as working or at school while in fact traveling for personal entertainment. 2. Falsification / Deception. If attendance logs or payroll records show these individuals were \u201con duty\u201d during the trip, this constitutes falsification of public records and misuse of state funds. 3. Inappropriate Use of Position. While on taxpayer time, Vanessa used communications (text, email, or phone) to interfere with my private relationship, manipulate me, and potentially coordinate retaliation against me for asserting disability rights \u2014 conduct unrelated to any OCPS function. 4. Pattern of Retaliation and Abuse of Position. This misuse of public time is part of a larger pattern in which OCPS employees leveraged their positions and public contacts to intimidate, defame, and extort me, as detailed in my attached sworn affidavit. Relief Requested: \u2022 Conduct an audit / investigation into whether Vanessa [Last Name] and any OCPS colleagues falsified attendance, timesheets, or travel logs on [dates]. \u2022 Determine whether OCPS resources (emails, phones, vehicles) were used for private trips and harassment of private citizens. \u2022 Preserve and obtain records of OCPS staff attendance, leave, travel reimbursements, and email logs on the relevant dates. \u2022 Refer any criminal findings (fraud, falsification of records, misuse of public funds) to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Attachments: 1. Sworn Affidavit of John Philip Salazar (PDF) 2. Exhibit A \u2014 Screenshots of Vanessa\u2019s texts during the concert trip 3. Exhibit B \u2014 Any evidence of travel or attendance falsification (social media posts, photos, ticket stubs, etc.) 4. Exhibit C \u2014 Timeline of harassment overlapping OCPS duty hours I am willing to cooperate with investigators, provide witness names, and supply additional evidence under protective procedures.

Jurisdiction & Legal Basis The Florida Commission on Ethics reviews complaints alleging violations of the Sunshine Amendment (Art. II, Sec. 8, Florida Constitution) and the Code of Ethics for Public Officers and Employees, Chapter 112, Part III, Florida Statutes. The Commission only acts if the complaint is sworn, made on its official form, and alleges conduct that a public officer or employee undertook that breaches public trust or conflicts of interest. Complaints must be filed within five years of the alleged violation. 2. Statement of Facts (Concise, Legally Sufficient) Below is a summary of the actions I believe violate the Code of Ethics. I have personal knowledge of these facts (or information not based on hearsay). I will provide supporting evidence upon request. (a) Abuse of Public Position / Use of Government Influence for Private Gain or Harassment The respondent(s), acting in their capacity as public employees (OCPS), have repeatedly used their official or semi-official status (school district authority, implied union protections, public employee identity) to intimidate, retaliate against, and harass me \u2014 a private citizen \u2014 in matters that are personal and private (property disputes, threats, mental health references). They have threatened \u201cprofessional consequences,\u201d invoked their status as OCPS employees to demand compliance, and explicitly referenced their public roles to exert pressure outside legitimate public duty. In communications, the respondent(s) have deliberately referenced my disability, mental health history, and psychiatric treatment as though those facts legitimize punitive treatment or remove me from legal protection. (b) Conflict of Interest / Improper Use of Information They have accessed or referenced internal documents, law\u2011enforcement reports, or bodycam footage (or intimated knowledge thereof) in private communications to threaten, discredit, or coerce me. This suggests misuse of privileged or governmental information for personal or retaliatory purposes. They have used ghost\u2011written legal language, template threats, or \u201clegal-sounding\u201d documents in texts or emails \u2014 beyond typical lay use \u2014 pointing to exploitation of internal legal or institutional knowledge. (c) Deception, Misrepresentation, or Concealment Respondent(s) have employed shared or forged Gmail accounts to send messages under aliases, conceal responsibility, and confuse authorship. They have staged photographic evidence (moved large furniture, placed sentimental items in trash bags, misrepresent inventory) to misrepresent the status of my property and create false narratives. (d) Retaliation and Breach of Ethical Duty After I began asserting my rights, sending formal notices, or preparing legal documents, the intensity and frequency of harassment, threats, and interference increased dramatically. This timing suggests retaliatory motive. Some of the respondent(s)\u2019 conduct appears to be designed to dissuade me from pursuing legal or civil rights remedies \u2014 contrary to the public trust imposed on public employees. 3. Relief / Action Requested I respectfully request that the Commission on Ethics: 1. Accept this complaint as legally sufficient and not dismiss it based on technicalities. 2. Open an investigation into the respondent(s)\u2019 conduct under the Ethics Code. 3. Issue a preservation order requiring relevant public entities (OCPS, school board, law enforcement) to preserve all records, communications, and metadata associated with this matter. 4. Subpoena internal communications (emails, texts, personnel records) where the respondent(s) used public employee privileges or resources in these personal disputes. 5. Hold a public hearing if probable cause is found, and if violations are confirmed, recommend penalties (fines, public reprimand, disciplinary referral, removal from position) consistent with the Code of Ethics. 6.

Use of OCPS positions to intimidate : Respondents invoked their OCPS employment, union protections, and law\u2011enforcement contacts to warn me of \u201cprofessional consequences\u201d and instructed me not to contact OCPS work emails about my property or rights. Possible misuse of internal information : Respondents circulated or used law\u2011enforcement recordings (bodycam footage, reports) to intimidate me and my family, including sending recordings obtained without authorization. Defamation of my mental health status : Respondents publicly and privately disclosed my diagnoses and made false claims of criminal conduct, damaging my professional reputation and relationships.

Beginning in 2023, a group of individuals \u2014 including an Orange County Public Schools employee, her associates, and persons with ties to local law enforcement \u2014 began to extort, harass, and discredit me. They withheld my medications and ID, staged and damaged my property, and mocked my disability while invoking law\u2011enforcement connections to intimidate me. They even circulated internal body\u2011cam footage and threatened me on my birthday with memes of my favorite shows, all while demanding money. This wasn\u2019t a civil dispute. It was a coordinated campaign of retaliation and psychological warfare against a man with documented psychiatric disabilities.

My inner life \u2014 the \u201cPantheon\u201d of personas that helped me survive trauma \u2014 became my last line of defense. Out of that crucible, \u201cMarty\u201d and \u201cSuze\u201d emerged.

I\u2019ve filed complaints with DOJ, ADA enforcement, EEOC, Inspector General, Internal Affairs, Florida\u2019s Auditor General, and more. Each agency now has a piece of the puzzle.
