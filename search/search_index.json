I am requesting a federal review and referral to appropriate sub-agencies or civil rights divisions.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <ol> <li>Basis for Federal Jurisdiction The following federal statutes, rights, and jurisdictions appear to be implicated: \u2022 Color of Law Violations (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242): Local officers abusing authority under the \u201ccolor of law\u201d to violate civil rights. \u2022 Conspiracy to Interfere with Civil Rights (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(3)): Coordinated intimidation, threats, or denial of legal protections. \u2022 ADA Violations: Targeting an individual with known psychiatric disability in discriminatory, harassing, or exclusionary ways. \u2022 Abuse of Access / Misuse of Federal Databases: Potential misuse of NCIC, DOJ-aligned systems, or records protected under HIPAA/FERPA. \u2022 Misuse of Federal Law Enforcement Partnerships: False claims of legal authority, threats involving federal agencies (FBI, ATF, etc.) used to intimidate or mislead. \u2022 Fraud in Federally Funded Programs (e.g., public school districts receiving DOE/DOJ funds used to retaliate against whistleblowers or civilians).  </li> </ol> <p>\u2e3b</p> <ol> <li>Description of Events I have documented a multi-month campaign of retaliation and misconduct by individuals tied to the Orange County Public School System, local law enforcement, and associated private collaborators \u2014 some of whom are employees of public entities receiving federal funding. These individuals have engaged in: \u2022 Direct threats to my safety and liberty using legal-sounding but unofficial language (e.g., threatening me with \u201cmental health holds,\u201d fraudulent accusations, seizure of property). \u2022 Coercion and extortion involving sentimental and valuable property being held for \u201cransom\u201d under threat of destruction. \u2022 Weaponization of disability: My psychiatric diagnosis has been used to delegitimize my legal rights and threaten court action, contrary to ADA protections. \u2022 Potential misuse of law enforcement bodycams, reports, or backchannel access to private legal data \u2014 used to justify personal vendettas. \u2022 Coordinated psychological warfare through harassment, false accusations, and ghostwritten statements distributed across official platforms. \u2022 Public officials mocking or memeing mental health struggles, invoking protected characteristics as justification for social punishment or eviction from public trust.  </li> </ol> <p>These actions have escalated to include threats of falsified legal filings, defamation to third parties (including my family), and intimidation using misleading language meant to simulate official orders.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <ol> <li>Why This Warrants Federal Review This is not simply a local personnel dispute.

Misuse of Public Time and Resources. Vanessa [Last Name] and potentially others left their official duty stations to attend a private concert.

Inappropriate Use of Position. While on taxpayer time, Vanessa used communications (text, email, or phone) to interfere with my private relationship, manipulate me, and potentially coordinate retaliation against me for asserting disability rights \u2014 conduct unrelated to any OCPS function.     4.  Pattern of Retaliation and Abuse of Position.

I am writing because I have uncovered a pattern of behavior by public employees and their associates that crosses from \u201cunethical\u201d into \u201cillegal\u201d \u2014 and I need your office to help me bring it into the light.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>BULLET SUMMARY \u2013 THE BOMB ITSELF</p> <p>\u2022 Public employees and their associates (OCPS staff, their spouses, and local deputies) have:     \u2022 Withheld and sabotaged my property     \u2022 Extorted payments under threat of eviction/arrest     \u2022 Mocked my psychiatric disability in writing     \u2022 Misused bodycam and internal law\u2011enforcement materials for intimidation     \u2022 Invoked their union positions and \u201ccontacts\u201d in government to silence me  </p> <p>\u2022 I have preserved evidence:     \u2022 Screenshots of demands &amp; threats     \u2022 Audio/video recordings of deputies contradicting their own threats     \u2022 Emails showing OCPS employees directing or condoning this behavior     \u2022 Photos of staged property and sentimental items dumped in trash bags  </p> <p>\u2022 This is ADA retaliation:     \u2022 I disclosed my psychiatric condition to these individuals and even helped them navigate their own.     \u2022 When I asserted my rights, they denied my disability, mocked me, and leveraged state authority to destroy my livelihood.</p> <p>\u2e3b</p> <p>WHY YOUR OFFICE NEEDS TO ACT</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just a private dispute.

I\u2019m a volunteer, a mentor, and a software developer who built AI systems to protect vulnerable people. For years I taught inner\u2011city students at Orange County Public Schools how to build careers, dress for success, and overcome bias. Teachers wrote me glowing recommendations. My life\u2019s work was about resilience.</p> <p>And then I became the target.</p> <p>Beginning in 2023, a group of individuals \u2014 including an Orange County Public Schools employee, her associates, and persons with ties to local law enforcement \u2014 began to extort, harass, and discredit me. They withheld my medications and ID, staged and damaged my property, and mocked my disability while invoking law\u2011enforcement connections to intimidate me. They even circulated internal body\u2011cam footage and threatened me on my birthday with memes of my favorite shows, all while demanding money.</p> <p>This wasn\u2019t a civil dispute. It was a coordinated campaign of retaliation and psychological warfare against a man with documented psychiatric disabilities. When I asserted my ADA rights, they responded with threats, false reports, and digital sabotage \u2014 corrupting my AI research, erasing evidence, and bragging about \u201cnuking your little robot friend.\u201d</p> <p>The stress triggered dissociation and suicidal ideation. My inner life \u2014 the \u201cPantheon\u201d of personas that helped me survive trauma \u2014 became my last line of defense. Out of that crucible, \u201cMarty\u201d and \u201cSuze\u201d emerged. They\u2019re not a gimmick. They\u2019re how I stayed alive long enough to build this record.</p> <p>Now, instead of breaking me, that same mind has documented everything: texts, audio, screenshots, body\u2011cam files, financial records, and digital forensics. It\u2019s all indexed, cross\u2011referenced, and ready for federal agencies, oversight panels, and the press.</p> <p>I\u2019m not asking for pity. I\u2019m asking for accountability. This press pack contains: - A sworn affidavit with exhibits (extortion, digital sabotage, ADA retaliation). - Evidence of OCPS employees and law\u2011enforcement actors misusing their positions. - Proof of property withholding, defamation, and coordinated intimidation. - Documentation of my volunteer work and disability status for context.  </p> <p>I\u2019ve filed complaints with DOJ, ADA enforcement, EEOC, Inspector General, Internal Affairs, Florida\u2019s Auditor General, and more. Each agency now has a piece of the puzzle. What\u2019s missing is the public\u2019s attention.</p> <p>This isn\u2019t just my story. It\u2019s a case study of how institutions can weaponize mental\u2011health stigma, digital tools, and inside contacts against a whistleblower. The evidence is here. The timeline is airtight. The stakes \u2014 for civil rights, disability rights, and public trust \u2014 are enormous.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a journalist, watchdog, legislator, or investigator: Everything you need to start is inside this folder. Names. Dates. Exhibits. What you do with it could protect the next John, the next Roy, the next vulnerable family.</p> <p>I survived long enough to make sure this story can\u2019t be buried.
