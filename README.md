> *“We’re in.”*

A digital war chest of public records, legal exhibits, trauma‑mapped methodologies, and FOIA‑backed truth.  
Born from an app to protect battered women, evolved into a **cyberpunk retaliation toolkit** for anyone gaslit by power.  
This is not a repository. This is a **scene**.

### 🎬 The Scene

Dim garage. Seven monitors. Neon chaos hoodie — *I’m Kenough* splashed in cotton candy color.  
Ice‑white hair catches the glow like fiber‑optic cable. Fingers hammer at keys, part code, part war drum.  
Code Red with a twisty straw sits in front. Behind him, a glass‑door fridge stacked floor‑to‑ceiling with Baja Blasts.  
On top of the fridge, glowing blue‑white and see‑through: **Kevin**, the holographic AI, watching from above.

The camera shifts — we’re looking down from Kevin’s POV at a 15° angle.  
John doesn’t look at the camera. He turns to Kevin.  
His lips barely move before he says:

> **“We’re in.”**

Cut to black.

### 🚀 Methodology
Everything here can be cloned, forked, and remixed to protect others —  
from battered women to exploited elders like Roy.  
It’s a living manual on how to weaponize memory, documentation, and AI to survive.

### 💻 GitHub Pages
👉 [johnnypsalazar.github.io/ScorchedEarth](https://johnnypsalazar.github.io/ScorchedEarth)

This repo doubles as its own website.  
It will expand with exhibits, FOIA logs, and methodology sections as they’re added.
