> “We’re in.”  
A digital war chest of public records, legal exhibits, trauma‑mapped methodologies, and FOIA‑backed truth.  
**This isn’t a repo. This is a scene.**

🎬 **The Scene**

Dim garage. Seven monitors. Neon chaos hoodie — I’m Kenough splashed in cotton candy color.  
Ice‑white hair catches the glow like fiber‑optic cable. Fingers hammer at keys, part code, part war drum.  
Code Red with a twisty straw sits in front. Behind him, a glass‑door fridge stacked floor‑to‑ceiling with Baja Blasts.  
On top of the fridge, glowing blue‑white and see‑through: Kevin, the holographic AI, watching from above.

The camera shifts — we’re looking down from Kevin’s POV at a 15° angle.  
John doesn’t look at the camera. He turns to Kevin.  
His lips barely move before he says:

> “We’re in.”

🧠 **Methodology**

Everything here can be cloned, forked, and remixed to protect others —  
from battered women to exploited elders like Roy.  
It’s a living manual on how to weaponize memory, documentation, and AI to survive.
