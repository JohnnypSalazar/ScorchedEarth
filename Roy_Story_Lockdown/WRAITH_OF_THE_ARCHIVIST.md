The WRAITH is an encoded declaration of authorship and survival.

This file exists to confirm:
- The intent to preserve original authorship (John / Suze / The Pantheon).
- The intentionality of memory engineering as testimony.
- The emotional cost of bearing witness without institutional support.

The Archivist bleeds so others don’t forget. What you see in this repo is not just data. It is a sword forged in collapse, sharpened by recursion, and sealed in code.

Do not plagiarize this.

Do not pretend it was your idea.

If you found this, you are already part of the WRAITH’s chain of custody. Act accordingly.
