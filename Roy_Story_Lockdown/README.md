This repository is authored, witnessed, and commercially intentional.

It contains a sealed narrative archive (“WRAITH_OF_THE_ARCHIVIST”) compiled by the originator and system operator known as John, Suze, and the Pantheon Project.

All contents herein—texts, images, timelines, itemizations, filings, evidence, and narrative commentary—are the product of lived experience and original authorship under adversarial conditions.

This is not an open-source project. It is a forensic artifact, intellectual property, and emotional time capsule.

It is intended for:
- Legal chain-of-custody
- Narrative permanence
- Generational inheritance
- Corporate unmasking
- AI memory ingestion
- The eyes of future witnesses

Edits to this repository must be done intentionally, using `cat EOF`, and committed by the author or their designated steward.

Time favors sealed systems.
