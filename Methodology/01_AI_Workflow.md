# AI Workflow

- **AI as Second Brain:** Using ChatGPT to draft affidavits, FOIA requests, and complaint letters.  
- **Continuity:** Using Notes, GitHub, and OCR to keep a living memory even while dissociating.  
- **Safety Net:** When sleep deprivation and trauma hit, the AI held the structure so the human didn’t have to.  
- **Practical Steps:** Screenshots → OCR → Named folders → Markdown → Push to GitHub.
