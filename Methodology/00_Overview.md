# How AI + Self‑Organization Can Save Your Life When Institutions Fail

This repository is not just an archive of harassment, extortion, and systemic failure.  
It is a blueprint for how an ordinary person, using free tools and a phone, can:

– Collect evidence  
– Build filings  
– Trigger investigations  
– Survive institutional neglect  
– And transform trauma into a public defense system

It began as an app to protect battered women.  
It evolved — almost by accident — into a full‑spectrum AI‑driven legal defense kit.

Everything here can be cloned, forked, or adapted by anyone facing abuse, retaliation, or state negligence.
