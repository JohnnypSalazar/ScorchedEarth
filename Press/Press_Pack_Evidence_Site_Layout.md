# 🗂️ Press Pack / Evidence Site Layout

Alright, Suze, deep breath. This is exactly where the overwhelm hits in every major investigation — right when the pile of material starts looking like a landfill.
The trick isn’t to make more paper; it’s to package it so it does the work for you.

Here’s how to do it so your website isn’t “a bunch of documents” but a living exhibit hall that also acts as your evidence locker:

---

## Front Page = The Story
– Your one‑page press sheet we just wrote.  
– A big button: “Download the Affidavit + Exhibit Index” (PDF).  
– A second button: “View Exhibits Online” (takes them into your folders).

---

## Folder Structure (think of it like a museum):

### 1. Affidavit & Index
- Affidavit_JohnSalazar.pdf (signed & notarized)  
- Exhibit_Index.pdf (one‑page list of every exhibit, like a table of contents with links)

### 2. Primary Exhibits (one folder per theme; number them)
- 01_Texts_and_Emails (Screenshots, PDFs of text threads, metadata files)
- 02_Audio_and_Bodycam (MP3/WAV files + transcripts)
- 03_Photos_and_Listings (Staged room photos, marketplace listings, sentimental items in trash)
- 04_Digital_Forensics (AT&T alerts, keylogger screenshots, corrupted JSON, device logs)
- 05_Volunteer_and_Disability_Docs (Letters of recommendation, presentation videos, medical verification letters)
- 06_Memes_and_Intimidation (The Schitt’s Creek meme, etc. — shows their tone and cruelty)

### 3. Official Complaints & Filings
- 01_Cease_And_Desist.pdf
- 02_DOJ_ADA_Complaint.pdf
- 03_EEOC_Complaint.pdf
- 04_Internal_Affairs_Complaint.pdf
- 05_Inspector_General_Complaint.pdf
- 06_DisabilityRightsFlorida_Complaint.pdf
- 07_Legislative_Package.pdf
- 08_PublicIntegrity_Unit_Complaint.pdf
- 09_CivilianReview_Board_Complaint.pdf
- 10_FOIA_Sunshine_Requests.pdf
- 11_FederalCivilSuit_ProSe.pdf

### 4. Press Pack / Watchdog Materials
- Media_Intro_CoverSheet.pdf (the one we just drafted)
- Press_Kit_Folder (logos, headshot, brief bio, one‑paragraph case summary for easy quoting)

---

## Navigation on the Website
- A left‑hand menu (or a simple “accordion” list) with numbered sections.
- Each section has a one‑sentence description and a download link.
- Optional: A “Timeline” page where you put a visual of key dates & events (can be as simple as a vertical list with dates, like a Wikipedia timeline).

---

## How It Works in Practice
- Reporters, lawyers, or watchdogs go to your site.
- They see your story first, not a wall of PDFs.
- Then they click “Exhibit Index” which acts like a map:  
  – “Exhibit A — Texts of extortion threats” → link to folder/file  
  – “Exhibit B — Audio of deputies” → link to file  
- Every document doubles as an exhibit because it’s listed in the index.
- If you later add a new filing, you just update the Exhibit Index with “Exhibit M,” link it, and you’re done.

---

## 💡 Pro Tip
Give each document a clear exhibit code (“Exhibit A,” “Exhibit B”) and also a descriptive title. Example:  
`Exhibit_D_Bodycam_Deputies_Saying_CivilMatter.mp4`  
`Exhibit_G_SchittsCreek_Meme.png`  

That way, anyone opening your folder or your website instantly knows what they’re looking at.

## This Way
- You’re not “making” 25 random documents.
- You’re making one Affidavit + one Index.
- Everything else is just evidence filed under an exhibit code.

When you drop it online, it’s both your story and your receipts. It’s also automatically your evidence locker for court.
