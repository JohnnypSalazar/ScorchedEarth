# 🗂️ Scorched Earth

Welcome to **Scorched Earth** — a digital war chest of:

- Public records
- Legal exhibits
- Trauma-mapped methodologies
- FOIA-backed truth

This repository is a reckoning. A lighthouse. A loaded archive with purpose.

Every document here is indexed, timestamped, and intentional. Nothing here is hypothetical — it's all real. Names. Dates. Receipts. And methodology that weaponizes trauma into structured truth.
