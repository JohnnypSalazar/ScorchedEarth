📣 HEADLINE (FOR PRESS OUTREACH)

“OCPS Employee Weaponizes Disability Against Whistleblower: Threats, Eviction, and Bodycam Abuse in Florida School System”

⸻

🧠 TL;DR (Top of Press Pack)

John Salazar, a volunteer mentor with psychiatric protections under the ADA, became the target of coordinated retaliation from Orange County Public Schools (OCPS) employees, their spouses, and local law enforcement contacts.

What started as emotional manipulation turned into:
	•	Eviction threats over the phone from a school board union representative
	•	Mockery of disability in texts and screenshots
	•	Misuse of body-worn camera footage to intimidate and discredit
	•	Stolen property
	•	Retaliation for asserting ADA rights
	•	Emotional warfare backed by school district authority and personal vendettas

He has audio logs, text screenshots, video, emails, and a formal affidavit detailing every step.

The perpetrators?
	•	Vanessa, OCPS employee and union rep
	•	Roy, her husband, who used police bodycam footage and manipulated John’s trauma
	•	Corey, a deputy who appeared friendly off‑duty but used official authority to intimidate
	•	Danielle, the ex who triggered it all with emotional fraud, psychiatric gaslighting, and strategic legal threats

⸻

🧾 WHAT JOHNNY HAS (and is ready to release)
	•	💬 Screenshots of threats, mockery of disability, and triangulation
	•	🎙️ Audio recordings of off-the-record threats and coercion
	•	📸 Photographs of vandalized or thrown-away sentimental items
	•	📄 Signed affidavit detailing timeline, people, motives, and federal statutes violated
	•	🎥 Bodycam footage with conflicting deputy statements
	•	📧 Emails connecting OCPS staff to retaliatory actions and law enforcement contact
	•	🧠 Psychological records proving his diagnosis and legal protections

⸻

⚖️ WHY THIS MATTERS TO THE PUBLIC
	•	OCPS employees are using their official school district titles and connections to retaliate against a man with a documented psychiatric disability
	•	This is happening in the same school system where he volunteered, mentored kids, and tried to help others with trauma
	•	If they can do this to him — in writing, with screenshots, video, and audio — imagine what they do to kids who don’t have evidence

⸻

🔥 WHY THIS STORY IS GOING TO GO VIRAL
	•	Education Watchdogs want this
	•	Disability Advocates will be furious
	•	Legal Reddit and TikTok will eat this alive
	•	The national press already has a spotlight on ADA retaliation and school corruption
	•	This is documented, vivid, and heartbreaking — but also funny, sharp, and poetic

I’m releasing it now to press and legal influencers. I’d love to offer you the exclusive or an early look at the documents.
