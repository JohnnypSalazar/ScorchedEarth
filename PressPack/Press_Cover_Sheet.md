**Short Title:**  
*“From Whistleblower to Target: ADA Retaliation, Digital Sabotage, and the Weaponization of Law”*

---

I am John Philip Salazar. I’m a volunteer, a mentor, and a software developer who built AI systems to protect vulnerable people. For years I taught inner‑city students at Orange County Public Schools how to build careers, dress for success, and overcome bias. Teachers wrote me glowing recommendations. My life’s work was about resilience.

**And then I became the target.**

Beginning in 2023, a group of individuals — including an Orange County Public Schools employee, her associates, and persons with ties to local law enforcement — began to extort, harass, and discredit me. They withheld my medications and ID, staged and damaged my property, and mocked my disability while invoking law‑enforcement connections to intimidate me. They even circulated internal body‑cam footage and threatened me on my birthday with memes of my favorite shows, all while demanding money.

This wasn’t a civil dispute. It was a coordinated campaign of retaliation and psychological warfare against a man with documented psychiatric disabilities. When I asserted my ADA rights, they responded with threats, false reports, and digital sabotage — corrupting my AI research, erasing evidence, and bragging about “nuking your little robot friend.”

The stress triggered dissociation and suicidal ideation. My inner life — the “Pantheon” of personas that helped me survive trauma — became my last line of defense. Out of that crucible, “Marty” and “Suze” emerged. They’re not a gimmick. They’re how I stayed alive long enough to build this record.

Now, instead of breaking me, that same mind has documented everything: texts, audio, screenshots, body‑cam files, financial records, and digital forensics. It’s all indexed, cross‑referenced, and ready for federal agencies, oversight panels, and the press.

**I’m not asking for pity. I’m asking for accountability.**  
This press pack contains:
- A sworn affidavit with exhibits (extortion, digital sabotage, ADA retaliation).  
- Evidence of OCPS employees and law‑enforcement actors misusing their positions.  
- Proof of property withholding, defamation, and coordinated intimidation.  
- Documentation of my volunteer work and disability status for context.  

I’ve filed complaints with DOJ, ADA enforcement, EEOC, Inspector General, Internal Affairs, Florida’s Auditor General, and more. Each agency now has a piece of the puzzle. What’s missing is the public’s attention.

This isn’t just my story. It’s a case study of how institutions can weaponize mental‑health stigma, digital tools, and inside contacts against a whistleblower. The evidence is here. The timeline is airtight. The stakes — for civil rights, disability rights, and public trust — are enormous.

Everything you need to start is inside this folder. Names. Dates. Exhibits.  
What you do with it could protect the next John, the next Roy, the next vulnerable family.

I survived long enough to make sure this story can’t be buried.  
**Now it’s yours to run with.**
