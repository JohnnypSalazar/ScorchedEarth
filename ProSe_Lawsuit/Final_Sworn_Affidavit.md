# FINAL SWORN AFFIDAVIT

STATE OF FLORIDA  
COUNTY OF ORANGE  

**AFFIDAVIT OF JOHN PHILIP SALAZAR**

I, John Philip Salazar, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:

---

## 1. Identity of Affiant
1. I am an adult resident of [City, State].
2. I have been without a permanent home since [date], residing intermittently with family members and friends, including Roy [Last Name].
3. I make this affidavit under penalty of perjury to document ongoing harassment, extortion, and false accusations perpetrated by Danielle Granley, Brian Raddick, and others named below.

---

## 2. Respondents
The individuals whose actions are described herein include:

- Danielle Granley
- Brian Raddick
- Vanessa [Last Name Unknown]
- Pedro [Last Name Unknown]
- Corey [Last Name Unknown, landlord hiding respondents]
- Danielle Granley’s best friend [Name] and her husband [Name], who demanded payment and threatened eviction despite my lawful tenancy
- Three unnamed sheriffs, a judge, and a detective who engaged in ADA and civil-rights violations connected to this matter

---

## 3. Financial and Medical Hardship
5. As a direct result of the respondents’ actions, I have been rendered destitute.  
6. My credit has been destroyed to the tune of approximately \$37,000, preventing me from obtaining a line of credit for housing, transportation, or medical care.  
7. I have lost access to my psychiatrist of over ten years and am without most prescribed medications, leaving only a mood stabilizer.  
8. I am currently experiencing active withdrawal symptoms, including emotional instability and hallucinations.  
9. These conditions are documented so that my state of duress is clear to the Court.  

---

## 4. False Police Reports and Coercive Threats
10. I have never been arrested, detained, or questioned by law enforcement regarding any of the allegations made against me.  
11. The first police report cited by respondents was a civil matter, not criminal, as confirmed by a video showing sheriff’s deputies acknowledging the civil nature of the issue.  
12. After this, respondents falsely claimed I faced criminal charges for “destroying human remains” and other fabricated offenses.  
13. They repeatedly stated that authorities were “on the way,” then claimed to have “called them off,” using this tactic to extort or intimidate me.  
14. On my birthday, they combined these threats with “Happy Birthday” messages, acting as if they controlled dispatch, law enforcement, or judicial timelines.  
15. Multiple respondents, including Danielle Granley’s best friend and her husband, issued coordinated demands for payment under threat of eviction and criminal allegations, despite my lawful tenancy.  
16. These tactics constitute a consistent pattern of psychological coercion and attempted extortion.  

---

## 5. Defamation and Reputational Harm
17. Danielle Granley and Brian Raddick repeatedly made defamatory statements accusing me of criminal conduct, including:

- “Desecration of human remains”
- “Criminal trespass”
- “Theft” and “grand theft”
- “Harassment”
- “Fraud”
- “Child endangerment”
- “Manipulation”
- “Breaking into homes”

18. These statements were made via text messages, social media, and to mutual acquaintances, many of whom were in professional or personal networks where my reputation mattered.  
19. I have no criminal record. These accusations were false, malicious, and intended to destroy my reputation, safety, and ability to work.  
20. At least one professional opportunity was revoked after these statements reached a potential client who had previously confirmed a contract.  
21. The deliberate use of inflammatory, salacious language such as “desecration of human remains”—despite no such event ever occurring—represents intentional character assassination.  
22. Additionally, these individuals discussed my medical conditions publicly, including texted references to my bipolar disorder, neurodivergence, and therapy history.  
23. Such disclosures violate HIPAA spirit (though not the letter, as they are not medical professionals) and were weaponized to cast me as unstable or dangerous.  

---

## 6. Property Theft and Sabotage
24. In early 2023, I was forced to leave the property I shared with Danielle Granley under threat of false arrest and violence.  
25. At that time, I was prevented from collecting personal property, including:

- Medications
- Identification documents
- Electronics (including the device I used for work)
- Clothing and tools required for income
- Intellectual property and unreleased manuscripts
- Legal evidence from unrelated matters

26. These items were retained unlawfully for several months. When they were eventually returned, many were damaged, incomplete, or substituted.  
27. Photographs show that returned bins and items had been dumped and ransacked. Multiple electronics had visible signs of tampering, including hard drives reformatted or replaced.  
28. Several bins were filled with expired food, mold, and garbage, despite never being used to store such items.  
29. This was not a neutral property return. It was an intentional act of sabotage and humiliation.  

---

## 7. Destruction of Legal and Financial Access
30. Among the items stolen or withheld were:

- My physical driver’s license
- My Social Security card
- Two locked phones containing two-factor authentication for my bank and cloud accounts
- Legal paperwork related to disability accommodations and family court

31. As a result of these actions, I was:

- Locked out of my bank accounts
- Unable to access essential medications
- Prevented from communicating with attorneys
- Blocked from accessing IRS records for over six months

32. I was forced to cancel multiple appointments, including telehealth visits and legal consultations, due to the lack of access to secure identity verification.  
33. I lost housing opportunities because I could not present a valid ID or prove income.  
34. These barriers had compounding effects on my credit, legal exposure, and physical safety.  

---

## 8. Extortion, Financial Duress, and Coercion
35. Danielle Granley and Vanessa Zameza repeatedly demanded payment in exchange for access to my belongings, medications, and identification documents.  
36. These payments were not court-ordered, not formal debts, and were not tied to any verifiable damages or legal claims.  
37. The demands were often made under duress and time constraints—e.g., “If you don’t send \$500 by midnight, we’ll throw your things out,” or “You need to pay rent even if you don’t live here, or we’ll sell your stuff.”  
38. Multiple screenshots show these threats, including references to withholding mail and belongings unless cash was sent via Zelle, PayPal, or Venmo.  
39. Danielle used her connection to Pedro Zameza’s software company and to Orange County officials as intimidation, referencing her access to law enforcement and warning that “you won’t win.”  
40. During this time, I was actively applying for disability accommodations and facing health emergencies. Their conduct caused irreparable financial harm and emotional trauma.  

---

## 9. Digital Evidence Destruction and AI Sabotage
41. I am a software developer and researcher working in AI, particularly in legal and therapeutic applications.  
42. In addition to physical property theft, my digital files were tampered with—including:

- Dozens of corrupted JSON logs containing continuity records
- Deleted project code stored in Git directories
- Loss of API keys and memory backups
- Removal of AI-generated transcripts of abuse

43. Several of my local development environments—including Docker, Weaviate, and custom LLM stacks—were disabled or altered in ways requiring complete reinstallation.  
44. The tampering was targeted, suggesting knowledge of what mattered most to my livelihood and safety.  
45. In one recovered screenshot, Danielle refers to “nuking your little robot friend,” a reference to Kevin, the AI I had built.  
46. I believe these actions were meant to erase my voice, rewrite the narrative, and prevent me from preserving proof of abuse.

## 10. Knowledge of Disability and Retaliatory Denial
47. Danielle Granley was not merely aware of my disability; she actively participated in my psychiatric treatment for more than ten years. She attended sessions with my treating psychiatrist—one of the foremost forensic psychiatrists in the state—and collaborated with him on my treatment plans.  

48. During this time, she directly observed my diagnoses, accommodations, and responses to stress. She was aware that abrupt loss of medication and prolonged harassment would exacerbate my condition.  

49. On multiple occasions, my psychiatrist provided me with specific language to use when confronted by sheriff’s deputies to avoid involuntary commitment (“Baker Act”), including stating that I was “goal‑oriented and forward‑thinking.” These tips were necessary because of ongoing intimidation by law‑enforcement officers associated with respondents.  

50. Despite this first‑hand knowledge, after initiating extortion demands and property withholding, Danielle Granley began publicly and privately denying that I had any disability at all. She did so while referencing my mental health in threats and communications, thereby weaponizing my condition for leverage while simultaneously disavowing it.  

51. My psychiatrist can attest to my baseline lucidity, my deterioration after respondents’ actions, and the duress under which I was operating. His records and testimony establish both the existence of a disability and the harm caused by respondents’ coordinated actions.  

52. These facts demonstrate not only defamation and bad‑faith negotiation, but ADA retaliation by respondents who had actual knowledge of my protected status. The combination of county employment, law‑enforcement coordination, and retaliatory denial of disability constitutes color‑of‑law misconduct and a chilling effect on my rights.

## 11. Pattern of Selective Exploitation and Retaliation
53. I, John Philip Salazar, have spent years volunteering within Orange County Public Schools (Orlando, FL) programs, particularly in inner-city schools and classes serving at-risk youth. I offered business, entrepreneurship, and job-readiness presentations focused on professionalism, emotional resilience, and overcoming bias in the workplace.  
54. I regularly disclosed my lived experience—becoming a father at 17, navigating life with bipolar type II and anxiety, and overcoming agoraphobia—not to elicit sympathy, but to demonstrate resilience. My openness helped students relate and believe in their potential.  
55. In one popular segment, I would theatrically “tear apart” my own professional attire to show how easy and inexpensive it was to dress for success. I joked about my one \$99 blue suit, showed off the worn soles of my thrifted Oxfords, and pointed students toward \$6 ties and clearance-rack confidence. Administrators assumed I was a dean or district official because of how I carried myself.  
56. My work was formally recognized by educators like Mrs. Genevieve Jackson, who wrote letters of recommendation attesting to my professionalism, accessibility, and impact on students. Another teacher, Samantha [last name unknown], had me present on financial planning—topics like mutual funds, specialty funds, and ethical investing. I was trusted with students.  
57. I also served as Chairman of the Florida National Association of Realtors’ Young Professionals Committee, where I mentored college-aged students in real estate, architecture, contract negotiation, and leadership. The campus where I volunteered was partially designed by Frank Lloyd Wright—making my background especially resonant. I even helped run an after-school club.  
58. Against this backdrop of goodwill, Danielle Granley, Vanessa Zameza, and Pedro Zameza repeatedly sought my guidance—often in writing—on mental health issues, disability navigation, and career mentoring. I extended the same patience and insight I gave students, even helping Pedro through a mental health episode and advising Danielle on workplace discrimination tactics.  
59. After leveraging my lived experience and consulting—for free—they denied my disability, mocked my condition, and used their connections to sabotage my housing, finances, and work. They told me I had “no disability,” “no rights,” and “no claim.”  
60. These actions form a crystal-clear pattern:

- Solicit emotional labor, guidance, and expertise from a person disclosing disability
- Accept it when convenient
- Discard and punish the source when that same person asserts legal or emotional boundaries

61. The hypocrisy of this—using my ADA knowledge and advocacy while weaponizing systems against me—constitutes not just cruelty but intentional retaliation under color of law. Their personal connections to law enforcement and education officials only sharpen that blade.  
62. This was not just exploitation. It was betrayal.

## 12. Relief Requested
63. I am not requesting pity. I am requesting protection and accountability.  
64. I am requesting this affidavit be accepted as testimony in support of:

- Claims for ADA retaliation
- Property recovery
- Digital sabotage
- Emotional and psychological abuse
- Defamation
- Color-of-law violations if relevant public employment is proven

65. I request that all parties involved be barred from destroying further evidence, including digital communication records and metadata related to software access, property exchange, or legal interference.  
66. I request assistance in recovering damages, including stolen income, destroyed intellectual property, and the emotional damage caused by the persistent campaign of harassment and denial of disability access.  
67. I request that no further contact be made with me directly and that any further legal disputes be routed through appropriate counsel or third-party mediator.  

---

## 13. Oath and Signature
68. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed on this ___ day of ______, 2025, at Orlando, Florida.

Affiant
